(it might overapproximate due to REST interface limitations)\n\nRelationship = {\n  link  : Link\n  deref : Collection -> [Model] | Model  // Once we have the other collection fetched, how do we actually get the related models out?\n}\n\n\nApi = {\n  \n  // Core Fields\n  // -----------\n\n  uri         : URL\n  collections : {String: Collection}\n\n  fetch       : () -> Promise Api\n}\n```\n\nImplementations\n---------------\n\nThe most important implementations are `RemoteModel`, `RemoteCollection`, and `RemoteApi`, which form a REST API client.\n\n - `RemoteApi` represents your `/api/`. It understands Django Tastypie schemas and can generate all of your collections simply by calling `fetch`.\n - `RemoteCollection` represents a list endpoint like `/api/book/`. It has additional methods `withData` and `withParam` for adjusting the HTTP requests.\n - `RemoteModel` represents a particular resource like `/api/book/25`.\n\nIn addition, there are `Local*` implementations of each, which are handy for testing with minimal mocking.\n\n - `LocalModel` where `fetch` and `save` each do their work in-memory.\n - `LocalCollection` which just contains the models you give it.\n - `LocalApi` which just contains the collections you give it.\n\n\nCaveats (Special Features?)\n---------------------------\n\n - Though used in large projects, Zoetropic.js is still new. It might be a bit crufty!\n - The module system is assumed to be AMD or Node. Pull requests welcome for other adapters.\n - There is a certain amount of direct support for Django Tastypie. This is a \"feature\" but means that it may be less helpful for other backends, without some customization. Again, pull requests welcome.\n\n\nCopyright & License\n-------------------\n\nCopyright 2013 Kenneth Knowles\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use\nthis file except in compliance with the License.
